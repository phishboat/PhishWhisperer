# PhishWhisperer
# I am an explorer, inventor, patent attorney, and student. 
## "Student" does not mean that I attend a school; I constantly study and try to apply my studies to my activities. My activities sometimes determine what I study (e.g. math, programming, abiogensis, etc.). 
# My activities include a "fishBOAT" and "exobiology on Earth". 
## The fishBOAT is a minimally actuated fish or marine mammal. I have developed both human and motor-operated versions. The motor-operated version can also be referred to as an AUV.
You can learn more about the fishBOAT at www.fishboat.net.
I am using Github to develop Arduino (C++) control scripts for the AUV.
## "Exobiology on Earth" is a theory I have had since 1997 that life would develop in computer media in the same way and for the same reasons that life originally developed in amino acid networks on early Earth. I call it "exobiology on Earth" because astrobiologists use the term, "exobiology" to refer to looking for life beyond Earth and because I want to look for the development of a new form of life right here on Earth, in new media. You can learn more about exobiology on Earth at www.exobiology.earth. Between 1997 and 2001 I wrote a science fiction book on the subject, titled Apokalypsis, which you can find at www.apokalypsis.com.
